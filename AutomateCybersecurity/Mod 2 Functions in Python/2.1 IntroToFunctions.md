# Functions in Python

function: a section of code that can be reused in a program. 

It is easier to make changes to function rather than changing all places that code may be used throughout a program.

built in function: functions that exist in python and can be called directly. EX. print

user defined functions: defined by programmers for their specific needs. 

## create a basic function

def: placed before a function name to define a function

```py
# define a function
def greet_employee():
    print("Welcome! You logged in!")

# call a function
greet_employee()
```
