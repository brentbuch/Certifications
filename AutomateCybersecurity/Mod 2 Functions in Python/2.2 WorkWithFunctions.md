# Working with Functions in Python

## Using Parameters

Parameters are an object included in a function definition for use within the function. 
Parameters are accepted into a function inside the parenthesis. 

Argument: data brought into a function when it is called. 

```py
# Greet employees by name

def greet_employee(name):
    print("Welcome! You are logged in", name)
    
greet_employee("Charlie Patel")
```

Functions can have multiple parameters.

```py
# Greet employees by name

def greet_employee(first_name, last_name):
    print("Welcome! You are logged in", first_name, last_name)
    
greet_employee("Charlie", "Parker")
```
